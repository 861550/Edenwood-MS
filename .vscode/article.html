                            content: `Yesterday, our school was placed under lockdown due to a missing X-Acto knife. This was a precautionary measure to ensure the safety of our students and staff. The knife was found later in the day, and the lockdown was lifted.\n\nPeel Regional Police made a post on x.com (formerly Twitter) consisting small details about the incident. The post stayed, but after an hour, there was a reply from the police stating that the lockdown had finally been lifted.\n\n"-LOCKDOWN LIFTED\n\nTurns out the knife was just misplaced..."\n\n- Peel Regional Police\n\nThe lockdown had started at 2:15 PM, at the time the students were preparing to go home. The lockdown had lasted for nearly 45 minutes. Students were directed to different places after the lockdown had been lifted, such as bus students heading to the gymnasium and the other kids to walk outside.\n\nThe next day, Vice Principal Mr. Grieve announced that the school did a wonderful job staying calm and quiet during the lockdown procedure.\n\nMr. Grieve had mentioned later that day that there was supposed to be a surprise fire drill that day, but due to the surprise situation the day before, he only announced it.\n\nThe school was back to normal the next day, and the students were able to go home as usual.\n`

                            title: 'New phone system; any differences?',
                            content: `Recently, you may have seen people replacing the black phones with the newer RCA 1103-1WTGA phone system. This phone system is a bit different from the old ones, and here are some of the differences:

            These phones tend to have better connectability between other landlines in the school and the outside world. This is due to the fact that the RCA 1103-1WTGA phone system is a newer model, and it has better technology.

            Another reason is the PA System quality. The RCA 1103-1WTGA phone system has a better PA System quality, which means that the sound quality is better. This is due to the fact that the RCA 1103-1WTGA phone system is a more advanced model.

            The only downside to this phone is that this phone doesn't have a built in LCD screen for time, or date, as the old one used to display. The older model used the LCD screen to display the time and date, but more importantly the person who was actually calling. Unfortunately on these phones, they do not have a built in screen, but rather just a keypad on the actual handset, not on any board or anything.

            So despite the phone being great, I didn't see any real problem with the old phones. But maybe it was for a good reason, so who knows?`

                title: 'Spring Music Showcase: Absolute Success!',
                content: `Our annual spring music showcase was held last Thursday evening, featuring performances from all grade levels. The event was a tremendous success, with over 100 family members and friends in attendance.

The evening began with our Grade 7 and 8 Concert Band performing a beautiful rendition of classic movie hits from "Jurrasic Park" and "Star Wars," followed by the talent show players' energetic performance of contemporary hits, like Elkan from 708 and his piano piece. The evening ended off with the Rock Band preforming various classic rock songs such as "Just" by Radiohead, and "Can't Stop" by Red Hot Chili Peppers.

Music teachers Mr. Zarnke and Mr. Domet expressed their pride in the students' dedication and hard work. The congratulations were sent to various teachers, such as both music teachers, Ms. M, Mr. Ladd, Ms. Jackson and Mr. Hoyte.

The school's music program continues to thrive, with many students participating in at least one musical activity. Plans will start to go underway for next year's showcase, which might include a special collaboration with the Choir.

We extend our gratitude to all the families who attended and supported our young musicians. Your encouragement means the world to them!`

                title: 'Edenwood placed under hold & secure due to incident at Meadowvale SS',
                content: `As a precautionary measure, Edenwood Middle School was placed under hold and secure protocols this morning due to an incident at nearby Meadowvale Secondary School.

The hold and secure was implemented at approximately 10:30 AM after we were notified by Peel Regional Police of a situation requiring additional safety measures in the area. During this time, all exterior doors were locked, and no one was permitted to enter or leave the building.

All students and staff remained safe inside the school, and regular classroom activities continued as normal. The hold and secure was lifted at 2:00 PM after police confirmed that the situation had been resolved and there was no threat to our school community.

Vice Principal Mr. Grieve praised the staff and students for their calm and professional response during the procedure. "Our regular safety drills prepared everyone well for this situation. Students followed protocols perfectly, and staff maintained a calm learning environment throughout."

We want to thank our school community for their patience and understanding during this precautionary measure. The safety and security of our students and staff remain our top priority.

If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to contact the main office at 905-824-1020.`

                content: `Did you know that Edenwood Middle School has quite the fascinating history? Our school has been serving the community for over four decades, and it hasn't always been known by its current name.

Originally opened in 1982 as Edenwood Senior Public School, our institution was one of the first purpose-built middle schools in the Peel District School Board. The name change to Edenwood Middle School occurred in 2003, reflecting the growing residential development in the surrounding area.

The school was designed with an innovative open-concept layout that was popular in the late 2000s, featuring flexible learning spaces and collaborative areas. Over the years, renovations have modernized the facility while preserving its unique architectural character.

Some interesting facts about our school's history:\n
- The original enrollment was around 480 students in grades 7-8\n
- The school's first principal, Mr. Hill, served for 4 years\n
- Our iconic oak tree in the front courtyard was planted during the opening ceremony\n
- The school has graduated over 8,000 students since opening

Today, Edenwood Middle School serves approximately 526 students and continues to be a cornerstone of our community. We're proud of our rich heritage and look forward to many more years of educational excellence.`
